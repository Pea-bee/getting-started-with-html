<h2>The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>


<b>The World Wide Web (or the web)</b>
<p>First we define a few terms:-<br> <br>
  A <em>web browser</em> is a program that runs on your computer to interpret and display files from the web on your computer.<br>
  The <em>internet</em> consists of the physical lines and routers to form the world's largest computer network.<br>
 <em>Servers</em> are the computers which host the files that make up the web.<br>
  <em>HTTP</em> is the main protocol that broswers use to communicate with the servers.</p>

 <p>The web is essentially a collection of HTML and other documents, 
 which are shared via the internet. 
 When you visit a web page, such as www.udacity.com, 
 your computer - via a web browser - transmits a HTTP 
 <em>Request</em> to a server over the internet.  
 The links between these web pages, called 
 <em>hyperlinks</em>, give the web its 
 weblike structure.<br><br>

  provides a good explanation.
</p>



<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> 
HTML documents are the basis for almost all web pages and form the majority of the content on the web.<br><br> 
HTML is made up of :-<br><br>
- <em>text content</em>, i.e. "what you see";<br> 
- <em>markup</em>, i.e. "how it looks";<br>
- <em>references</em> to other documents, such as images and videos; and<br>
- <em>links</em> to other pages.<br><br>
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This video</a> 
  provides a good overview.</p>

<b>HTML Markup</b>
<p>HTML documents consist of a series of HTML <em>elements</em>, and when writing HTML 
we use HTML <em>tags</em> to tell the browser exactly which element is to be rendered on the page. 
The tags essentially seperate normal text from the HTML code and allow all the interesting 
stuff such as images and videos.  Tags can be <em>closed</em>, e.g. when making type <b>bold</b>, 
or <em>void</em>, e.g. when displaying images.</b><br><br>
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a> 
  gives a good description.
</p>

<b>Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Programmers needs to write in a language the computer understands, and
because computers interpret instructions literally, a small error by a "smart" programmer
can lead to huge problems in a program due to a "stupid" computer. 
</p>

<b>Inline v Block</b>
<p>HTML elements can be either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content, which allows <em>attributes</em>
  such as height and width.  Inline elements occupy only the space bounded by the tags which contain the content.
  Examples of such elements are <em>line breaks</em> and <em>anchors</em>.
</p>

<b>Span v Div</b>

<p>There exists ways to attach <em>styles</em> to content which allow us to adjust the
behaviours of how they display. <b>Span</b> is inline while <b>Div</b> is block.</p>
